Tools for accessing iNaturalist API.

# TODO:

- Learn the API and how to fetch new and updated observations
- Compare Finnish names to Laji.fi names
  - Compare iNat Finnish names to Laji.fi Finnish names, by connecting them with sciname
  - How many of Finnish species are found in the taxonony, and how many of them have names?

# Notes

Observations, all grades (25.8.2019)
- Finland 18722 (c. 5% marked as captive/cultivated - do we want these also? No.)
- Estonia 3425
- Sweden 35828
- Norway 30872
- Russia (are these areas overlapping?)
  - Republic of Karelia 6587 (bounding box, includes some of Finland also)
  - Murmansk Oblast 1223
  - Leningrad Oblast 10641 (bounding box) 
- Total c. 107,000

Licenses?

Data export tool: https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/export
quality_grade=any&identifications=any&captive=false&place_id=118841

There are two API's:

## Write-Read API

https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference

- More functionality, used internally
- Here's instructions how to get OAuth access token
- Ruby on Rails

## Read-only API v1

https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/

- Read-only observations and stats, recommended for this
- Faster, more consistent responses
- Node
- Max 60 (100) requests / minute, under 10,000 requests / day

Multiple values for a single URL parameter should be separated by commas, e.g. taxon_id=1,2,3.

Authentication in the Node API is handled via JSON Web Tokens (JWT). To obtain one, make an OAuth-authenticated request to https://www.inaturalist.org/users/api_token. Each JWT will expire after 24 hours. Authentication required for all PUT and POST requests. Some GET requests will also include private information like hidden coordinates if the authenticated user has permission to view them.

API is intended to support application development, not data scraping.

## DW API

POST /warehouse/push 
DELETE /warehouse/push 

Push vai custom solution, e.g. with flat nightly updated table?

### Push
- Simple for FinBIF
- If push fails, system needs to log this, so that can be pushed again later
- Middleware needs
  - Push, starting from oldest, based on edit time (additions, edits and deletions)
  - If failure (error code) or timeout, log timedate for that record
  - After sleep time, restart starting from that datetime

Logic:
- Api endpoint is called e.g. every 1 hour (the more often, the less obs is handled at a time)
- Can give parameter for datetime (for debugging), or leave it out
- If no param, get it from a text file
- Call inat api with edited datetime, country and other params (tbd), sorted by edited datetime desc
- Go through obs
  - For user id's, look match from cache file. If not found, fetch from api and add to cache file
  - Convert to DW json array
- Go through json array
  - Push to DW. If success, log latest edited datetime. DONE
  - (On validation failure, log observation id)
  - On timeout or DW failure (including validation failure), stop the process
- Use try/catch. On failure, write to log. On success, write to log.


### Custom pull
- Simpler for source system, can focus on data harmonization
- If pull fails, DW needs to take care of pulling again, starting from provided datetime
- Middleware needs:
  - Since datetime parameter
  - List additions, updates (persistent id) and deletions (persistent id)

## Notes about the data

Records have varying CC licenses, or no license at all (=all rights reserved).
What to do if license is missing, or noncommercial. Remove free text fields? Save free text into field, which is not downloadable?

API does not seem to allow sorting based on when observation was modified. Therefore cannot go through the observations in order. Therefore must handle all observations since last fetch in a single transaction.

APi allows fetching observations which have been updated since timestamp. However, what is counted as an update?
- Edit obs details - YES
- Adding YES or removing id YES
- Adding YES or removing annotations YES
- Upvoting NO!!! or downvoting quality grade annotations
  -> If this is true, we must re-index everything once in a while, to update quality_metrics

annotations
Is this Life stage? Yes.
          "user_id": 78963,

photos, observation_photos  what's the difference? where to put count?


DW:
- record id: ??
- userId: inaturalist:id

- quality level in original source:
  - community verified
  - neutral
  - uncertain

What to do if user changes their observation license?
- Follow the new license, and delete the observation if new license is ARR
  - Downside: we lose observations which we legally could keep
- If license cnages towards more strict (either within CC or from CC to ARR), don't update the record
  - Downside: we don't get updates, like error corrections


Additions needed to DW:
- license for each record
- Source annotation data?


--

out_of_range (true | false | empty): is the observation outside "known range" of the taxon
  true => needsChecking, created by system

user_login > use api to get full name, if exists
